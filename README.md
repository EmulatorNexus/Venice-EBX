# Venice EBX Text Dump

This repository contains a full text dump of all partitions (EBX) and their contained instances for Venice (Battlefield 3) to be used as reference when modifying game data in [VU](https://veniceunleashed.net). For more information about what partitions and instances are and how data is structured refer to the [Frostbite data basics](https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/vext/guides/data/) guide.

This dump is generated using Rime and a modified version of [Frankelstener's ebx conversion script](http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.php?/topic/15531-ebx-file-converter/) from a fully updated version of Battlefield 3 with all DLCs and locales.
